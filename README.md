# System Software Project : Driving Management System

This system is developed for a driving test center which manages one day data of registered candidates. It conducts a driving test and on basis of driving score and elapsed time it will assign pass or fail result to each candidate. It uses different text files for maintaining data. We have implemented the following system software programming concepts :
- File I/O
- Process Management
- Inter Process Communication with pipes
- thread Management 

We also implemented linked list Data Structure in our Project.

To compile this program, simply run command:
**make all**

to run the program:
**../bin/main.out ../dataFiles/person_list.txt**

to clear or remove all the previously crated object files, run cmd:
**make clean**
